# WIP: Recho Melody

> A chronological editor for coding with piano.

Code and music have something in common: graphical music scores guide musical activity in time, and code executes in time in unique ways.

This also means that pianists and coders have something in common: when they press the keys, things come to life. One creates sound, the other creates visuals. **What if both happened together? Let's see—and listen.**
